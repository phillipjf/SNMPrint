COMP 3710 - Wireless Software Engineering
Spring 2015
Term Project
Assignment
	You are to build an Android app of your choosing.
Objective 
	The term project is hands-on application of the skills you learned this semester. My expectation is that you will approach building an Android app in a disciplined fashion, following sound engineering principles.
Requirements 
	• Development Logistics:
		− You may work in a team of 2, 3, or 4 people. The team roster must be listed in Canvas.
		− Your app must have features commensurate with the size of the team.
		− Your app must have demonstrable usefulness.
		− Your app must be built with targetSDKVersion=18 and minSDKVersion=14. It must be capable of running on a Nexus 5 (4.95”, resolution:1080x1920). Use edu.auburn.eng.csse.comp3710.teamxx as your package name, where teamxx is the name of your team as shown on Canvas.
		
	• Deliverable material:
		− Use cases, domain model, system sequence diagram
		− Class diagram(s), sequence diagram(s)
		− As appropriate: activity diagram(s), state diagrams(s)
		− .apk file
		− All material needed to build the app from scratch.
		− Release notes.

	• Baseline software specifications:
		− The app can be paused without loss of state. In other words, the application must handle the receipt of a phone call; another application being started while your application is running; your application being paused and subsequently killed to conserve resources; etc.
		− The app should handle changes in screen orientation, unless there is a justifiable reason to lock the app in a specific orientation and prevent screen rotation. Justification should be provided in the release notes.
		− The app must have a prolog screen (also known as a splash screen) that shows
			o a logo for the application
			o the name of the application
			o the name of the members of the team
			o "Auburn University COMP3710 Spring 2015"
		− The app must have a unique launch page icon.
