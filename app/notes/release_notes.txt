RELEASE NOTES:

SNMPrint uses SNMP to check status of network printers. The user is able to enter an IP address for a printer and the app will query the printer for it’s ink levels and return to the user a graphic representation of the levels. 

-The app maintains a SQL database of the printers entered by the user
	-The database supports all CRUD functions
-The app runs network queries in an Asynchronous Task to avoid becoming unresponsive

-For now, the app is central to Auburn’s network (Only allows IP addresses 131.204.116.XXX)


TO-DO:
-Allow user to enter full IP addresses
-Create better layouts on change orientation
-Handle printers with non-standard CMYK ink


Some values to try for IP Address:
176, 179, 183, 185, 186, 188
(Must be on Auburn's network)
